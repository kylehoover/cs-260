          I'm currently working on automating frequently occurring, high priority tasks at my
          current job, and providing access to those tasks through a friendly and intuitive admin interface.

          The board game, but as an Android application that supports multiple users playing on
          different devices. By far the most intense project I've worked on.

          Hughes Value Model
        </h2>
        <p>
          At my internship this past summer at Hughes, I refactored their value model web tool.
          It was originally used internally by the company, but they wanted something more available to their clients. The
          main focus was to make it mobile friendly and to update the design. You can see the two versions below.
