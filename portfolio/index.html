    About
  </h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I am a senior studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I am also a full-stack web developer working at
    the BYU English Language Center. I love tennis and reading, and am currently slightly obsessed with the board game
    Secret Hitler.

    Projects
  </h2>
  <hr />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>LATs Admin Interface:</b> I'm currently working on automating frequently occurring, high priority tasks at my
      current job, and providing access to those tasks through a friendly and intuitive admin interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Ticket to Ride:</b> The board game, but as an Android application that supports multiple users playing on
      different devices. By far the most intense project I've worked on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Hughes Value Model:</b> At my internship this past summer at Hughes, I refactored their value model web tool.
      It was originally used internally by the company, but they wanted something more available to their clients. The
      main focus was to make it mobile friendly and to update the design. You can see sites below.
